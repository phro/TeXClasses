LaTeX Classes for Math Related Papers
=====================================

Introduction
------------
This repo contains a few different classes of TeX document classes that one may find useful when writing papers relevant to the different subjects. These are centred around streamlining the homework typing process, but they may be helpful in other ways as well. I will add more classes as I take more courses (i.e. Topology, perhaps?)

Analysis
--------
This class is currently being used for an introductory undergraduate course on multivariable calculus. The course focuses on some elementary topology of $\R^N$.

Algebra
-------
I am currently taking an introductory group theory course, and this class is tailored to dealing with group theory. As more algebra courses are added to my repertoire, this will expand, and may eventually split into more subjects. :)

Topology
--------
Coming Soon (or never) ...
As I have not formally taken a course in this subject, I don't quite know what commands/ structures would be useful for an assignment class in a topology course. Check back in 2015 :)
